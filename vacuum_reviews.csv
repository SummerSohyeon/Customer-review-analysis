Lydia Martinez,4.0,"February 20, 2023",United States,Yes x3,"I was so skeptical at the time i opened it n saw such a small suction. But i used it in my car where my dog always rides shot gun. N the car is full of fur. I vacuumed the seat the floor the dash the console the door. HECK I VACUUMED THE DOG. i wanted to see how good it was. It vacuumed his loose hair right off. I had a cup full of his fur.
The reviews were right down side was the brush. Not that it didnt work but u want ant extra one or a bigger one. I didnt even use the exta accesseries. But i was just amazed on how much fur it picked up. N i keep it in my car still plugged in so when ever im driving n im at a red light i vacuum myself the fur thats on me. I look pretty silly at the red light. But its getting att the fur."
Ohukno,4.0,"June 18, 2021",United States,Good device with some flaws,"I wish I would've taken a before and after picture! You'll just have to take my word for it. So initially I was skeptical of this vacuum because of its small size. I noticed there were TONS of reviews though, mostly decent, so I decided to pull the trigger on it. I have a messy toddler and am about to have my second baby, so the idea of being able to plug it in right in my car and do some cleaning, was really appealing. I also really like the idea of having different attachments for cleaning nooks and crannies. I decided the other night to get it out and give it a shot and I'll say, initially I wasn't overly impressed. I plugged it in and turned it on (yes, with my vehicle running) and thought, ""wow, that's it?"" But when u started vacuuming with it I was actually pretty impressed. So NO, you're not going to get industrial vacuum-quality with this device. However, like I said, if you want to be able to take your time at your own house and so some car cleaning, this device is great. It actually did a pretty good job of cleaning my carpets and giving my car a refresh. I loved that the attachments helped me get into spaces I'd never have access to with the vacuum at the car wash. So between the counsel and the seats, etc. The hose in my opinion is shaped oddly and doesn't work too well, but I loved the brush and the straight attachments. The hose plugs in one way to the vacuum and then faces a different direction at the end, so it's pretty uncomfortable trying to straighten it out to fish it down into a nook. Not bad, though. Just personally won't be using that attachment as much. I like that it includes a brush for the filter and an extra filter. What I did find annoying was that the suction power was lacking if even the smallest amount of dirt and hair stuck to the filter. So I felt as though I was constantly emptying the dust cup even when I should've been able to fill it up more. Lot of dirt and particles like to stick right around the tip where it sucks, right in the crack between the opening and the outer plastic. So that was annoying, but holding it facing up and giving it a few good taps sent the dust down with the rest of it by the filter which was good. I did notice that when you open it and take the filter out to dump the dust, the rubber ring on the filter gets dusty and makes it difficult to seat it back into place within the plastic so you can click that back onto the actual vacuum. So tinkering with that was pretty annoying trying to get it to seat correctly so I could get back to vacuuming. It took me quite a while to complete but my car also hadn't been vacuumed in a while. All in all, I would say this is a really good but also flawed device that is nice to have if you don't like having to go to the car wash to clean out your car, or you have small and messy children like I do and want to be able to clean up after them in a pinch and at home. This device as I mentioned earlier is also quite good for the nooks and crannies the car wash vacuum heads simply cannot reach. However if you're expecting professional detailer-quality results, you'll likely be disappointed. This vacuum does have pretty good suction power but some stuff that is almost weaved into the carpet fibers still remains. It is not perfect, and i would say it's not quite as professional quality as the claims state on the box. It also claims you can clean wet messes with it, however I have not tried that as of yet and am not sure I'd be comfortable testing that. So, all in all, if you're looking for what i described, you should definitely get this product. However if you're looking for something more professional grade, you may want to look into something a lot more powerful. I am happy with the value of it, and hope to get a lot of use from it."
Nicole N.,4.0,"March 3, 2023",United States,Great for quick clean ups,This little vacuum is better than I expected it to be. It has a long cord so you don’t have to worry about reaching the entire car. The suction could be better but I am using this in between deep car cleans and for quick mess clean up from the kids. I would recommend for anyone that lives at the beach or has small kids.
Jacquelyn B. VINE VOICE,4.0,"January 18, 2023",United States,"nice accessories for a car, but I prefer a more general dust buster","Color: BlackVerified Purchase
This is a cute and moderately effective vacuum with a lot of pluses for cleaning a car: the storage bag is great, the included accessories are ideal for reaching between seats, the suction is strong enough to get the one cashew your kid has somehow wedged into a cranny. It's easy enough to clean out after use, up to and including changing the filter. And it's small enough to travel in the car full time without sacrificing much cargo space.

The downside of a car specific vacuum is that it is specific to cars. This is designed to plug into a car outlet, so you can't easily clean a spill on the couch if all you can find is your car vacuum. This one is a bit small for cleaning the floor of the car, and the size somewhat limits the suction."
Liz Curruchich,4.0,"January 16, 2023",United States,Works great with powerful suction!,"The vacuum worked great! Husband and I took a long road trip with a very messy toddler, the vacuum picked up all sorts of crumbs, hair and even road salt! The cord reaches all the way from the front to the back in my midsize SUV with extra length to spare. The only downside of this product is the vacuum needs to be plugged in the entire time in use in the car charging outlet, if I were to buy the product again I would spend the extra money to buy the rechargeable version or the one that has the normal outlet but that is only for the convenience and because I would love to be able to use it inside as well for hard to reach and small areas like the kitchen drawers and things. Overall recommend!"
AndoD,4.0,"February 3, 2023",United States,Great Product!!!,"I rarely give out a 5 star to any product. This product perhaps deserves a one! Yet I feel every product has room for improvement! The suction power is excellent. Note this product is not for really deep cleaning, it’s simply to small for such work. It cleans very well for its size. The various attachments work wonderfully. The cord length could be slightly longer for use in SUV’s & large vehicles. The storage bag is a little small making it a bit difficult to pack everything in.
It is overall a great product. I recommend this product!!!"
Brenda S,4.0,"March 14, 2023",United States,Looks like described,"When I first used it, it worked good second anthill it gradually losing suction strength. Other then that it's nice for the money wish suction was stronger."
Animal Crazy,4.0,"March 11, 2023",United States,Awesome,This mammy jammy is the bomb diggidity!! Sucktion is great!! My only hang up is vacuum hose could be more durable but all in all it gets the jobs done!
cynthia perez,3.0,"January 16, 2023",United States,Good for what it's worth...suction could be better,"I received this as a Xmas gift, which I really appreciated. My wife knows I like keeping our cars as clean as possible. My review in brief: nothing will come close to the vacuum cleaners available at car washes or vacuums like a Shop Vac, but I do wish the This Worx vacuum cleaner had better suction. It picks up top layer (loose) debris fairly easily, but it takes a bit more elbow grease to pick up lint and small particles that get into the fibers of the carpet. This a nice on-the-go, compact car vacuum option for what it is.

While the manufacturer recommends having the car on to get maximum power out of the ThisWorx, I didn't feel or see much difference with the car off (plus who wants to leave their car running for 10-15 minutes). For those hard to suction particles, I recommend using the brush that's included and really giving the vacuum some good strokes across the carpet surface to loosen and pick up those pesty particles. This seemed to be the most effective way to really put this vacuum to the test. However, there will still be some debris left behind (I'm a stickler for a clean car so for me this was a negative).

Among the items included in the handy bag (a big plus) is a small hose. When added onto the vacuum to pick up trash in hard-to-reach places, the hose didn't initially do much and took a few passes to really suck up trash. Speaking of attachments, they fit in easily and tightly, but you have to give them a good yank to take them off.

The 16 foot cord is a huge plus and it's really nice that they include an extra filter (and brush to clean the filter). Overall, this is an OK, light weight mini vacuum cleaner and I would recommend it but with a ""buyer beware"" noting my feedback. For stronger suction, it looks like ThisWorx offers a cordless vacuum cleaner with a 60W motor, which I'm assuming is stronger than the one I was gifted.

I hope this review helps. Happy cleaning."
